    <string name="about_desc">Milo of Croton (c. 6th-century BC) was alleged to have achieved his legendary strength by lifting a newborn calf and every day repeating the task until it was as large as a bull. Why? Because there wasn\'t a whole lot to do in the 6th-century.\n\nEmbrace his legend and Poosh yourself with progressive resistance training!\n\nMilo reportedly died when he tried to tear a tree apart, became trapped, and was devoured by wolves.</string>
